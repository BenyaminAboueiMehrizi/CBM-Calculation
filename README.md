# 📦 Shipping Cost and Time Estimator (China to Iran)
This project is designed to accurately estimate the **time and cost of shipping goods from China to Iran** by considering various key factors. These factors include the type of goods, their volume, and specific packaging and transportation conditions, all of which affect the final cost and shipping duration.

## 🚀 Features
- **Shipping Time Estimation:** Calculates approximate shipping time, accounting for loading, transportation, and customs clearance.
- **Cost Calculation:** Estimates the cost based on the chosen shipping method (air, sea, or land).
- **CBM Calculation:** Calculates cargo volume in cubic meters (CBM) for precise cost estimation.
- **Shipping Method Comparison:** Compares different shipping options to help users choose the best balance between speed and cost.

## 🛠️ How It Works
- **Air Freight:** Fastest but most expensive option, suitable for time-sensitive goods.
- **Sea Freight:** Cost-effective for bulk cargo, but with longer delivery times.
- **Land Freight:** A middle-ground option for specific routes, balancing cost and time.
